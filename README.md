## Introduction of C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that supports both low-level and high-level programming. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an extension of the C language, adding features such as classes, templates, exception handling, and more. C++ is widely used for developing operating systems, device drivers, system software, desktop applications, video games, and other complex software.

## Features of C++

Some of the main features of C++ are:

- Object-Oriented Programming: C++ allows you to create classes and objects, and to define methods and properties for them. Classes and objects enable you to organize your code in a modular and reusable way, and to implement concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Templates: C++ templates enable you to write generic code that can work with any data type, without having to write multiple versions of the same code. Templates can be used to create generic classes, functions, and algorithms, and to implement concepts such as generic programming and metaprogramming.
- Standard Template Library (STL): The STL is a collection of containers and algorithms that provide common data structures and operations for C++ programs. The STL includes containers such as vectors, lists, maps, sets, and more, and algorithms such as sort, search, copy, and more. The STL makes it easier to write efficient and effective code in C++.
- Exception Handling: C++ provides a mechanism to handle errors and unexpected situations that may occur during the execution of a program. Exception handling allows you to throw and catch exceptions, and to define custom exception types and handlers. Exception handling helps you to write robust and reliable code in C++.

## Advice:
 - Set the environment variable by entering the path to the Mingw64/bin folder (compiler)
 - Terminal command to compile and execute (windows): **g++ name.cpp -o new_name** (compile the file)     and      **.\name.exe** (execute)
